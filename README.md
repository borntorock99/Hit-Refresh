# Hit-Refresh

While attending Microsoft Ignite 2017 and thanks to a diligent coworker, I was able to get a copy of Satya Nadella’s new book, H
it Refresh: The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft’s Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone.
Reading it on the flight back from Orlando, I found it the unexpectedly personal story of one man and the inevitable
possibilities for our collective future. Its pages hold incredible perspectives for LiveTiles, Tri-Cities, and the future.
From Coder to King
The early chapters deal with Satya’s personal story coming from India and arriving at Microsoft in 1992. 
While it sounds like he played too much cricket to be a true nerd, it definitely sets the stage for his fascination with technology 
at a young age. He benefited immensely from a one-of-a-kind education in Hyderabad
joining a cohort that went on to lead massive companies like Adobe, MasterCard, and others.
