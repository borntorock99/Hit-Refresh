# Hit-Refresh

While attending Microsoft Ignite 2017 and thanks to a diligent coworker, I was able to get a copy of Satya Nadella’s new book, H
it Refresh: The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft’s Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone.
Reading it on the flight back from Orlando, I found it the unexpectedly personal story of one man and the inevitable
possibilities for our collective future. Its pages hold incredible perspectives for LiveTiles, Tri-Cities, and the future.
From Coder to King
The early chapters deal with Satya’s personal story coming from India and arriving at Microsoft in 1992. 
While it sounds like he played too much cricket to be a true nerd, it definitely sets the stage for his fascination with technology 
at a young age. He benefited immensely from a one-of-a-kind education in Hyderabad
joining a cohort that went on to lead massive companies like Adobe, MasterCard, and others.

The “Hell Has Frozen Over” shot
My first introduction to Satya Nadella, like a lot of people on the technical side, was the day he shifted Microsoft’s attitude on competition with the big “Microsoft ❤ Linux” reveal. The transformation Satya started has come to define the new strategy for Microsoft. Spreading from growth mindset to an attitude of abundance by partnering with competition where it makes sense, even if that partner might be competing across other axes.
Case studies and a complete vision for this model is contained in the chapter “Friends or Frenemies” and constitutes the most important part of the book for current tech leaders who only see enemies across a battlefield when in the expo hall at Ignite. By platforming each component of the business and abandoning the notion of exclusive vertical integration (an approach still clung to by the likes of Apple and others), Microsoft can now find more opportunities and feed more projects than ever.
Each platform LiveTiles develops is intended to remix the best of what customers already have. Every IT dollar the customer has spent on other technologies is magnified by our presence and our partner network get to share our customers with us. My team builds only horizontal, extensible platforms and seek to connect rather than compete with other systems. These decisions are born from the same “partner or perish” mindset that Microsoft has mastered and is such a big part of the MS turnaround in just three years.
