# Hit-Refresh

While attending Microsoft Ignite 2017 and thanks to a diligent coworker, I was able to get a copy of Satya Nadella’s new book, H
it Refresh: The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft’s Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone.
Reading it on the flight back from Orlando, I found it the unexpectedly personal story of one man and the inevitable
possibilities for our collective future. Its pages hold incredible perspectives for LiveTiles, Tri-Cities, and the future.
From Coder to King
The early chapters deal with Satya’s personal story coming from India and arriving at Microsoft in 1992. 
While it sounds like he played too much cricket to be a true nerd, it definitely sets the stage for his fascination with technology 
at a young age. He benefited immensely from a one-of-a-kind education in Hyderabad
joining a cohort that went on to lead massive companies like Adobe, MasterCard, and others.

The “Hell Has Frozen Over” shot
My first introduction to Satya Nadella, like a lot of people on the technical side, was the day he shifted Microsoft’s attitude on competition with the big “Microsoft ❤ Linux” reveal. The transformation Satya started has come to define the new strategy for Microsoft. Spreading from growth mindset to an attitude of abundance by partnering with competition where it makes sense, even if that partner might be competing across other axes.
Case studies and a complete vision for this model is contained in the chapter “Friends or Frenemies” and constitutes the most important part of the book for current tech leaders who only see enemies across a battlefield when in the expo hall at Ignite. By platforming each component of the business and abandoning the notion of exclusive vertical integration (an approach still clung to by the likes of Apple and others), Microsoft can now find more opportunities and feed more projects than ever.
Each platform LiveTiles develops is intended to remix the best of what customers already have. Every IT dollar the customer has spent on other technologies is magnified by our presence and our partner network get to share our customers with us. My team builds only horizontal, extensible platforms and seek to connect rather than compete with other systems. These decisions are born from the same “partner or perish” mindset that Microsoft has mastered and is such a big part of the MS turnaround in just three years.



LiveTiles Bots — the new AI platform LiveTiles revealed at Ignite 2017 — fulfills Satya’s vision. The LiveDev team has made a simple tool for designing a unique bot for every use case in an organization, with a bespoke language model for each user. Starting with scenarios like employee on-boarding, helpdesk, and digital executive assistants, we’ll help teams transform existing business systems into intelligent agents. Unlike all-in-one/on-for-all style digital assistants like Cortana (which we do still use as a channel via Bot Framework), LiveTiles Bots enables a unique identity and set of abilities to make the digital workplace full of digital workers — adapting to humans rather than humans adapting to them.
And what do the humans do once AI has eliminated all drudgery? Thankfully, Hit Refresh has a vision for that as well: focusing on the comparative advantage of being Homo Sapien. Providing the empathy in the workplace, the creativity in the work, and the accountability for each technological component that will so rapidly change the economic and social landscape. I welcome a future where we get to be more human because intelligent technology means we can stop thinking like machines.
Reasonable, Foreseeable Cyberpunk
Among the visions of the future, Satya touched upon some shifts in commerce and government that read like Cyberpunk come to life. Since first becoming a fan of the genre playing Seattle-based role-playing game Shadowrun way back in middle school, I’ve always considered the 80s vision of the future represented in Neuromancer and Johnny Mnemonic an unlikely and bleak possibility, but Hit Refresh has unique sections that portray the rise of corporations over states and the medium of technology becoming the primary conduit of culture as desirable, irreversible, and even







A Blueprint for Tri-Cities
The final chapter of the book, “Economic Growth for Everyone”, is the most most prophetic for Tri-Cities. While ostensibly talking about developing nations in Africa and Asia, it hits upon an approach for “under-served parts of the world” which I believe represents the best economic remedy for Americans far from urban centers. Linking education, innovation, and entrepreneurship into a virtuous cycle is Satya’s prescription and I agree.

A nexus of tech entrepreneurs in Tri-Cities, WA
Key ideas, like “growing local tech entrepreneurs” rather than trying to attract Silicon Valley opportunities resonates with me as a Tri-Citizen. Focus on fostering human-capital and next-generation skill development, along with trying to recognize a place as a “startup city” (without necessarily triggering the Cyberpunk concerns of loosening regulation, rather simply focusing culture) are all analogs to what Fuse Coworking & Accelerator in Tri-Cities, WA is trying to do every day. Without the grassroots making connections and sharing ideas, there would have been far less human capital in Tri-Cities for LiveTiles to open an office. Without the combination of local investment in people and global opportunity in business, there is no future.
Satya outlines a formula for economic growth we can emulate:
Sum of (Education + Innovation) X Intensity of Tech Use = Economic Growth
In the digital age, software is a universal input to progress and a geographically unconstrained output to the economy. This encourages me to keep advocating, educating, and launching new ideas from Tri-Cities, driving more education and innovation for my hometown so it can be magnified out into international growth.
Satya Nadella may be about 4 hours away from Tri-Cities every day, but the work we do in the LiveTiles Tri-Cities office is transported to Microsoft instantly. If more Tri-Citizens can harness their human capital and focus on exports, if only acrossthe Cascade Mountains led by the insightful and empathetic Satya Nadella himself, then a sustainable future for our community is possible. Think global, code local.
I would recommend any leader in an AI startup like LiveTiles, aspiring scholar of the potential Cyberpunk apocalypse, or Tri-Citizen to read Hit Refresh by Satya Nadella. It comments on the rewritten source code of a corporate giant and discusses the little things that make us human. It shows the vulnerability of a man who leads over a hundred-thousand employees, provides platforms for millions of jobs in an expansive tech ecosystem, and the ethics of an industry that will change billions of lives.
